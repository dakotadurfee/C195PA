Title: Scheduling application

Purpose: This application was made for an imaginary third party company that needs a scheduling application. The company conducts business in multiple languages and
has customers in different time zones. This program displays appointments in a table and the user can change the table to view appointments by different criteria.
The user can add or modify appointments and customers. The application has error checking for any change made to appointments or customers. If there are no errors the
application adds or updates appointments or customers in the database. The application displays times in the users time zone and stores times in the database in UTC.
There is also a reports page that can display appointments by contact, type, month, or customer. Any login attempt is documented and appended to a txt file that says
when the attempt was made and if it was successful or not. The login form is translated to French or english depending on the users OS language settings.
